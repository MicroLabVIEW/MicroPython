### Our Mission

At picoG we make graphical (G Dataflow) programming accessible to everyone and deployable to any imaginable device or platform.

(Right now, we're working on PicoG Desktop which allows you to deploy LabVIEW NXG 5.1 "G Web VIs" to the Raspberry Pi Pico.)

## Our Sponsors and Supporters

We'd like to thank our sponsors and supports for making picoG possible.
