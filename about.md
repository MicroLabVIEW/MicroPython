picoG is made freely available under the MIT open source license, in order for it to be accessible to everyone.

### Team

This project was launched via a mashup of another crazy idea of [Jim Kring](https://github.com/jimkring), some brilliant brainstorming with [NatanBiesmans](https://github.com/NatanBiesmans), and the C++/Microcontroller/LabVIEW/Software wizardry of [Derrick Bommarito](https://github.com/negentropicdev).

[Click here](https://github.com/PicoG/PicoG/graphs/contributors) to see all our contributors on GitHub.

We're hoping to add others to the team, so [join the discussion](https://github.com/PicoG/PicoG/discussions) if you're interested!

### Our Mission

#### _At picoG we make graphical (G Dataflow) programming accessible to everyone and deployable to any device or platform._

(Right now, we're working on PicoG Desktop which allows you to deploy LabVIEW NXG 5.1 "G Web VIs" to the Raspberry Pi Pico.)
